  <p> Their existence stretches back some 145.5 million years. Lotus flowers even survived the Ice Age (1.8 million – 10,000 years ago). 
    Most plants in the northern hemisphere became extinct during this era.Lotus flowers appear most prominently in wetlands and usually grow in mud. But they are also very adaptive to their local environments. They can survive under ice as long as their roots remain in water or mud.</p>
  <p> The lotus has a unique daily life cycle of life, death, and rebirth. This has led to the phrase, “lotus flower of life”.That is why it’s meaning is often “rebirth”, and why the flower is frequently tied to spirituality. In Hinduism and Buddhism, they’re considered the most sacred flower. Vietnamese and Indian people often associate the flower with gods and goddesses.</p>
